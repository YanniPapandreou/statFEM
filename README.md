# Overview

This repo contains code accompanying our error analysis of the Statistical Finite Element Method (StatFEM) as described in the paper by Girolami et al. [1]. The code accompanies [2].

`oneDim` contains code needed for our 1-D example while `twoDim` contains code needed for our 2-D example. `maxDist` contains required code for our 1-D max example. The other notebooks all contain the relevant code for each experiment.
